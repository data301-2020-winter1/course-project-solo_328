## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
I aim to analyse data on the daily top trending YouTube videos. Since YouTube is a popular social media platform globally, the trending videos could reflect sentiments and topics of interest around the world during the time frame of the dataset. Iâ€™m interested in answering the following questions: What themes and topics are reflected in trending videos? Do any of the columns of data predict the number of likes a video will get? What are the common themes and major differences between trending videos across the 10 countries? What is the average time from publish date to trending date? I can imagine building a user-facing Dashboard with the dataset, since there are many questions that can be presented.
## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
This is a dataset of daily top trending YouTube videos from 10 different countries, collected from 1 December 2017 to 31 May 2018. This data was sourced using YouTube API by Mitchell J on Kaggle, who is a software developer at Backbeat Technologies in the United Kingdom. As such, this data could have been retrieved due to public interest. It is listed as public domain. If possible, I would like to get current data myself from 2019 to 2020 using the YouTube API. 
The dataset contains video id, trending date, title, channel, category id, publish date, tags, views, likes, dislikes, comment count, thumbnail link, comments or ratings disabled, videos removed and a description of the videos. The 10 different countries for which data is available are Canada, Germany, France, Great Britain, India, Japan, Korean, Mexico, Russia, and the United States.
